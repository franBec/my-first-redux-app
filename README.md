# So...

This Create React App + Redux was made as a follow along of the 7th part of the course [React.JS, Gu√≠a desde 0](https://www.udemy.com/course/reactjs-guia-desde-0/)

It is a good course, but when reaching the Redux part you already know Zustand. So it becomes very boring the boilerplate Redux makes you do

For that reason, I was no so motivated when making this app (you can notice how little effort I put in the detail view, the last one I made)

So don't expect a clean code, or a nice UI. This just works and that's it
