          This Create React App + Redux was made as a follow along of the 7th
          part of the course{" "}

            <span className="underline">React.JS, Gu√≠a desde 0</span>

          It is a good course, but when reaching the Redux part you already know
          Zustand. So it becomes very boring the boilerplate Redux makes you do
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For that reason, I was no so motivated when making this app (you can
          notice how little effort I put in the detail view, the last one I
          made)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So don't expect a clean code, or a nice UI. This just works and that's
          it
